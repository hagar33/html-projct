What would our shelter-in-place COVID-19 experiences be like in Canada without engineering technology advancements such as smart phones, Zoom, Amazon or Netflix? What would the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 be without technology advances in health care that have allowed us to decode the novel coronavirus genome in a month, access geospatial information systems to help pinpoint areas of infection and the use of ventilators to treat critical patients? Engineers are some of the people behind these technological developments; their role in society is to connect scientific and technical knowledge to societal needs. Although engineers are not the front-line medical responders who put their lives at risk each day in our fight against COVID-19, they are some of our hidden heroes whose work is critical to support people both as they endure this pandemic as well as save people's lives in this race against time.

   Because of these technological advances, we are more equipped now than in any other era to respond to a pandemic.

During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, there was neither a cure nor a vaccine for the disease nor the ability to manage the undertaking of mandatory quarantine or self-isolation. Lacking the technology we have today, there was no way to curb the spread of the Spanish flu, which killed more than 50 million people and caused more than 500 million infections worldwide.

In 1918, there were few cars, no highways, no air travel. There were limited telephones and people relied primarily on newspapers, leaflets and the radio to receive information. Typically, a white scarf tied to a door of a house was a sign that there was a virus residing within.
